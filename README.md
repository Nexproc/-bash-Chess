# $bash Chess
###How to get started
Make sure you have Ruby installed. The best tutorial I found was: [Ruby Installation Tutorial](http://installrails.com/steps)
- Download the ruby chess file [here]()
- Unzip the file
- Open your $bash terminal
- Navigate to the folder in terminal
- Run the command `$ bundle install` in the terminal
- Run the command <code>$ ruby game.rb </code> to start the game
