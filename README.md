# $bash Chess
### How to get started
Make sure you have Ruby installed. The best tutorial I've found was: [Ruby Installation Tutorial](http://installrails.com/steps)
- Download the ruby chess file [here]()
- Unzip the file
- Open your $bash terminal
- Navigate to the folder in terminal
- Run the command `$ bundle install` in the terminal
- Run the command `$ ruby game.rb` to start the game

## Controls
- Use the arrow keys to move the cursor across the board.
- Select a piece with `enter`
- Move the cursor to a valid position; highlighted by darker, green squares.
- Press `enter` again to select your piece placement.
- Want to cancel a move? Just select a move at an invalid position or select the position of you current piece.
